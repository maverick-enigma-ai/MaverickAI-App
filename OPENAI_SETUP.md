**For psychological profiling feature:**

1. In Assistant settings, add "Response Format":

```json
{
  "type": "json_schema",
  "json_schema": {
    "name": "psychological_analysis",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "overview": {
          "type": "string",

    }
  }
}
```

2. Save assistant

**This enables:** Structured psychological profiling data for visualizations

2. Allows users to upload screenshots/images
3. AI analyzes body language, expressions, etc.

### **Enable File Search:**
1. Tools ‚Üí Enable "File Search"
2. Upload reference documents (psychology books, etc.)
3. AI uses knowledge base for richer insights

### **Adjust Temperature:**
- Lower (0.3): More consistent, less creative
- Higher (0.8): More creative, less predictable
- Recommended: 0.5 for psychological analysis

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

**Reduce costs:**
1. Use GPT-4 Turbo (cheaper than GPT-4)
2. Set max tokens: 2000-3000
3. Cache common queries
4. Implement rate limiting

**Monitor usage:**
- Dashboard ‚Üí Usage
- Set up billing alerts
- Track cost per query

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **"Invalid API key" error**
- Check `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Verify key hasn't expired
- Check billing account is active

### **"Assistant not found" error**
- Check `VITE_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID` is correct
- Verify assistant wasn't deleted
- Create new assistant if needed

### **"Insufficient quota" error**
- Add credits to OpenAI account
- Check billing dashboard

### **Slow responses**
- Normal: 5-15 seconds for complex analysis
- Optimize: Reduce max tokens
- Consider streaming responses

---

## üìä Monitor Performance

**Check metrics:**
- Response time (avg 10-15 sec)
- Token usage (avg 1500-2500 per query)
- Error rate (should be <1%)
- Cost per query (avg $0.02-0.05)
